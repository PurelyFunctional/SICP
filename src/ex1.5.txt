If the interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation, the expression will not finish being evaluated because the procedure 'p' is evaluated before it gets passed in.

If the interpreter uses normal-order evaluation, the expression will evaluate to 0 because arguments that are passed in are only evaluated only when they are needed and 'p' is never needed (the if-expression will evaluate to 0).
